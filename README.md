# nodejs-with-express-adopt-a-pet

Step 1
Here we have the basic set up of a express.js app. In the original folder we have the initiated project with express and nodemon installed and we have set the scripts
so we can use them both with nodemon and node.
Now, in this file:
- We required express (you can also import it).
- We created app.
- We created port.
- We have created our first route.
- We are listening to the port.
